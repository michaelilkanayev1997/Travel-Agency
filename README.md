 A Website for managing the Travel Flights booking at the Travel Agency (local host).
 This is a project I did in REACT with FIREBASE as part of an introductory computer communication course in the third year.

### `Users can:`
1. Register and connect conveniently
2. choose a flight according to its date and time, country
3. Change a number of tickets (if available) till the “booking” (that is, after the number of tickets is chosen and payment is processed, the number of tickets cannot    be changed).
4. Make a payment

### `Flight options:`
1. has a list of flights with their destination and origin country, flight date and time, price
2. a flight list can be ordered according to : price increase, price decrease, most popular, country, Airline company.
3. Direct flights only.
4  two-way flight.

### `Buying a ticket:`

   ability to pay with a PayPal (redirection to a PayPal site using its API)
   Show notification message after the payment is accepted or failed. After that, a user is
   redirected to the Invoice.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
